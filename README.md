# 🔐 Obfuscated Code Banner  

### 👩‍💻 HARSHITHA S , COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT 

> A creative Python-based project that encodes identity using obfuscated logic — used as a *LinkedIn cover image* to showcase both personality and technical skill.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project transforms a *simple identity message* into an *intelligently obfuscated Python script*, which, when executed, reveals:

*HARSHITHA S, COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT*

Used as a *LinkedIn background image*, this unique concept blends logic, creativity, and branding — ideal for students, developers, and professionals looking to stand out.

## 🧩 How It Works

```python
import base64

part1 = [72, 65, 82, 83, 72, 73, 84, 72, 65, 32, 83]
part2 = "Q09NUFVURVIgU0NJRU5DRSBTVFVERU5U"

name = ''.join(chr(i) for i in part1)
role = base64.b64decode(part2).decode()

print(f"{name}, {role}")

🔍 Breakdown

Element	Description

part1	List of ASCII codes for your name
part2	Base64 string for your role
Output	Prints: HARSHITHA S, COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENT
